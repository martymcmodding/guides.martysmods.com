iMMERSE Ultimate: ReGrade + is a commercial-level color-correction suite for ReShade, inspired by industry-standard tools. It eliminates the need to leave the game for detailed adjustments, allowing real-time color correction with an intuitive UI. This makes it a seamless experience for users, especially those knowledgeable in Color Theory, Photography, and Image Post-Processing.

:::warning
ReGrade + requires the Addon Support build of ReShade in order to function properly, otherwise the screen will be black when the shader is enabled.

## Enabling ReGrade +

Before adjusting parameters, move the "ReGrade +" tab to a separate window in the ReShade/Game UI. This controls the entire shader and lets you tweak other effects while viewing the results in real-time. Enabling the shader alone won't activate it. If any component is not running, the Addon/Shader Window will indicate it, like so:

## Scopes

The "Scopes" section provides graphical representations of various color statistics and balances. By default, it shows the "Histogram RGB," which displays exposure and color values of the current scene. You can select different options from the drop-down box:

- **Histogram Y:** Displays the luminance levels of the image, giving you a clear idea of brightness distribution across the scene.

    ![Histogram Y Image](https://assets.martysmods.com/shaders/regradeplus/regradeplus_histogram_y.webp)

- **Histogram RGB:** Shows the color levels of the image, separated into Red, Green, and Blue channels.

- **Waveform Y:** Visualizes the luminance levels in a waveform/spectral format, providing a detailed overview of brightness intensity at specific points.

- **Waveform RGB:** Displays the color levels of the image using a waveform, showing each RGB channel independently.

- **Waveform RGB Parade:** Separates the color levels by channel in a parade format, making it easier to analyze the individual contributions of Red, Green, and Blue channels.

- **Vectorscope:** Shows the chroma distribution of the image, helping to analyze color saturation and hue. Ideal for balancing skin tones and monitoring overall color fidelity.

- **Vectorscope 2x Zoom:** A zoomed-in view of the Vectorscope, providing finer detail and precision when analyzing chroma data.

## Tweaks

The "Tweaks" section is designed for general adjustments to the image's brightness, saturation, and other basic settings. It offers quick changes without delving deeply into image formatting. The options are categorized, with each category containing several sub-categories:

![ReGradePlusTweaksSection](https://assets.martysmods.com/shaders/regradeplus/regradeplus_tweaks.webp)

- **White Balance:** Adjusts colors and tones related to temperature and bright points.

    - **Temperature:** Adjusts the color temperature of the image.
    - **Tint:** Adjusts the color tint of the image.

- **Exposure:** Controls image illumination, lighting, and exposure, with some color adjustments.

    - **Exposure:** Changes how much light the image absorbs. Lower values darken the image, higher values brighten it.
    - **Contrast:** Adjusts the contrast levels of the entire image.
    - **Gamma:** Modifies the image's overall brightness.
    - **Filmic Gamma:** Adjusts brightness specifically in dark and mid-tone areas.
    - **Saturation:** Controls color saturation. Higher values increase colorfulness, lower values desaturate the image.
    - **Vibrance:** Enhances the intensity of colors. Higher values make colors more vibrant.

- **High Dynamic Range:** Fine-tunes the image's lighting across different brightness levels.

    - **Shadows:** Adjusts the brightness of the grey areas.
    - **Darks:** Controls the brightness of the darkest areas.
    - **Lights:** Sets the brightness of the brightest areas.
    - **Highlights:** Adjusts the brightness of the highest light points. It's recommended to keep this level above the "Lights" setting.

## Tone Curves

"Tone Curves" is one of the various interactive widgets available for the user in ReGrade+. With this, you can make your own tonemap, which means you can choose how bright and dark each color or even the luminance levels are in a curve, essentially changing the image lighting level even further to suit your needs.

By default, it comes enabled in the "RGB" mode, which tweaks all of the 3 main colors (Red, Green and Blue) toning and brightness. However, you can change to a per-channel mode by clicking the coloured squares in the lower part of the Graph.

To start using it, click on a point in the graph and move it to start changing the tone curve. To plot a new point, click somewhere else and move that point. The changes, along with the graphic, will all update in real-time.

## Color Correction

The "Color Correction" section is subdivided in two: "Split Toning" and a "Color Wheel".

"Split Toning" allows you to change the colors on a per-light level basis. It has 3 wheels: "Shadows," "Midtones," and "Highlights." There are two ways you can edit those values: you can either click on the point on the center of the color wheel and move it to where you want it to be, or you can drag the gauges left and right for more granular and fine-tuning of the values.

![ReGradePlus Split Toning Wheel Example](https://assets.martysmods.com/shaders/regradeplus/regradeplus_colorcorrection.webp)

The second wheel allows you to change the color values of Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Aqua, Purple and Magenta by Luma (brightness) and also Saturation (Amount of Color).

By default, the Color Wheel comes configured to change the color values based on Luma ("Hue vs Luma"), but you can change the values you're choosing by clicking on the small wheel. This allows you to change between the first mode and the "Hue vs Saturation" mode. To tweak the values, click on the color you want to change and move it with the Mouse. By holding the "Shift" key, you can linearly move it in the vertical/diagonal axis, preventing mistakes when you want to change its saturation or brightness without changing the color tone. To reset the values of a changed color, right click on the point you want to reset. 

While this part of the shader doesn't allow you to drag any sort of gauges, it allows you to see how much of the values are changed in each section of the spectrum.
