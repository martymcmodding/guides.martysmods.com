# Film Grain

METEOR: Film Grain simulates authentic film grain and digital sensor noise. It recreates the characteristic texture of analog film photography and digital camera sensors, providing realistic grain effects that enhance cinematic quality.

## Parameters

### Film Mode

Selects the color processing mode:

- **Monochrome:** Grayscale grain for classic black and white film aesthetic
- **Color:** Color grain for color film or digital sensor simulation

### Grain Type

Determines the grain characteristics:

- **Analog Film Grain:** Organic, irregular patterns with film curve characteristics
- **Digital Sensor Noise:** Structured, pixel-based patterns

### Intensity

Controls the overall strength and visibility of the grain effect.

### Animate Grain

Enables temporal animation for dynamic, moving grain that simulates film projection.

### Noise Saturation

Adjusts the color saturation of grain in digital sensor mode.

### Bayer Matrix RGB Weighting

Applies realistic camera sensor characteristics by weighting RGB channels according to Bayer pattern layouts.

### Grain Size

Controls the scale of grain particles in analog film mode.

### Analog Film Gamma

Adjusts gamma curve characteristics for specific film stock simulation.

### Analog Film Shadow Emphasis

Controls grain emphasis in shadow areas, simulating film behavior where grain becomes more prominent in darker regions.
