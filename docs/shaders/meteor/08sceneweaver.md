METEOR: SceneWeaver provides tools for advanced screenshot composition, hotsampling, and cinematic framing. It includes hotsampling viewport management, cinematic letterboxing, and an advanced canvas system with composition guides.

## Parameters

### Hotsampling

#### Your Screen Width

Sets the target resolution width for hotsampling viewport management. The shader resizes the game viewport to this resolution for consistent framing.

### Letterbox

#### Preset

Selects from predefined cinematic aspect ratios:

- **Custom:** Allows manual ratio setting
- **1:1:** Square format
- **5:4:** Classic photography ratio
- **4:3:** Traditional television ratio
- **3:2:** Classic 35mm film ratio
- **16:10:** Widescreen computer ratio
- **Golden Ratio:** Aesthetic 1.618:1 ratio
- **16:9:** Standard widescreen ratio
- **1.85:1:** Cinematic widescreen
- **2:1:** Ultrawide format
- **2.35:1:** Cinemascope format

#### Custom Ratio

Sets a custom aspect ratio when preset is set to Custom.

### Canvas

#### Zoom Out

Provides a zoomed out view to help identify composition issues.

#### Rotation

Allows rotation of the canvas view, useful for portrait hotsampling orientations.

#### Canvas Brightness

Controls the canvas background brightness. Neutral grey makes exposure judgment easier than black or white backgrounds.

#### Grid

Selects composition overlay grids:

- **None:** No grid overlay
- **Rule of Thirds:** Standard compositional grid
- **Golden Spiral (Various positions):** Multiple golden spiral overlays for different compositional approaches

#### Grid Opacity

Controls the transparency of the composition grid overlay.
