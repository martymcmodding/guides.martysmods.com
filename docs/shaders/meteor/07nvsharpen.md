METEOR: NVSharpen is a high-quality image sharpening filter ported from NVIDIA's NIS Library. It provides advanced edge detection and sharpening capabilities that enhance image clarity and detail.

## Parameters

### Sharpen Intensity

Controls the overall strength of the sharpening effect. Higher values create more pronounced sharpening with increased edge contrast.

### Edge Detection Threshold

Determines the sensitivity of the edge detection algorithm. Higher values make the shader more selective about which edges to sharpen, while lower values enable sharpening of finer details.
