Unfortunately, the Patreon and Discord intergration for larger servers and Patreon communities is slow. In order to force Patreon to provide you the benefits that you've paid for on our Discord (for downloading our shaders and being a part of our community) you can follow the steps provided below:

---

## Leave the Discord Server
If you are already a member of the Discord server you'll need to leave the server manually. You can do this by going to the top of Discord on the left hand side, clicking "PGHub" and then clicking "Leave Server".

## Open Patreon's "Connected Apps" Settings
First, click the hyperlink here in order to navigate to [Patreon's 'Connected Apps' Settings.](https://www.patreon.com/settings/apps/) Once there, you'll see the "**Discord**" button. Click it and continue.

If you do not have a Discord account linked, you will need to do so in order to progress to the next step.

## Join the Discord Server through Patreon
Now that you're at the connected application page for Discord, click "Join Server" for the Discord Server.
