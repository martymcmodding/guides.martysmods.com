## Use Case
Unfortunately, the Patreon and Discord intergration for larger servers and Patreon communities is slow. In order to force Patreon to provide you the benefits that you've paid for on our Discord (for downloading our shaders and being a part of our community) you can follow the steps provided below:

If you are already a member of our Discord server, it's best to leave the server manually. You can do this by going to the top of Discord on the left hand side, clicking "PGHub" and then clicking "Leave Server".

First, click the hyperlink here in order to navigate to [Patreon's 'Connected Apps' Settings.](https://www.patreon.com/settings/apps/) Once there, you will be greeted with a host of applications that you can connect to your Patreon account.

Once there, click the "**Discord**" button.

Now that you're at the connected application page for Discord, click "Join Server" for the Patreon server for "Pascal Gilcher".
