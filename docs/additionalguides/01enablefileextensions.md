By default, Windows hides the file extensions for known file types. This means that common file types like `.txt`, `.ini`, or `.exe` will not display their extensions in the file names. While this might seem convenient, it can cause confusion when you need to identify specific files or change file types. This guide will walk you through the steps to show file extensions, so you can always see them.

## Make File Extensions Visible

2. Under the **Advanced settings** section, scroll through the list until you find an option labeled **"Hide extensions for known file types"**. By default, this box is checked, which means file extensions are hidden.
   
3. To show file extensions, **uncheck** the "Hide extensions for known file types" box by clicking on it.
