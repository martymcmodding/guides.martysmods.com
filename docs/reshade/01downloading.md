# Downloading ReShade

ReShade is an open-sourced, generic, post-processing tool that allows users to currate the looks that they want in their game of choice. In order to reduce abuse from ReShade in online/multiplayer games, there are two builds that you can download. The latest version of ReShade will always be available at [ReShade's Homepage](https://reshade.me/#download).

## Standard ReShade Build (Download ReShade X.X.X)

The Standard Build of ReShade is ideal for online games with strict anti-cheat mechanisms. This is due to its limitations to features in relation to external add-ons and the depth buffer when network connectivity is detected. As a result, certain depth effects like ambient occlusion will often times either not work or flicker rapidly in some games.

## Full Add-On Support ReShade Build (Download ReShade X.X.X with full add-on support)

The Full Add-On Support Build of ReShade is best for offline games or games without anti-cheat systems. This build offers the full feature provided from external add-ons and an entirely unlocked depth buffer, regardless of your network connectivity. However, this build is almost entirely blocked by most anti-cheat solutions.
