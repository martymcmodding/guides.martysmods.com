# Downloading ReShade

ReShade is an open-sourced, generic, post-processing tool that allows users to currate the looks that they want in their game of choice. In order to reduce abuse from ReShade in online/multiplayer games, there are two builds that you can download at [ReShade's webpage](https://reshade.me/#download).

## Standard ReShade Build (Download ReShade X.X.X)

The Standard build of ReShade is the recommended choice for games that block the addon support build of ReShade or have anti-cheat systems that dislike graphics injections and mods. This build is specifically designed for online multiplayer games, as it has a hardcoded implementation to block access to the depth buffer (when internet connectivity is detected) and all external add-on based solutions. This intentional limitation helps prevent cheating and reduces the likelihood of anti-cheat systems blocking ReShade entirely.

## Full Add-On Support ReShade Build (Download ReShade X.X.X with full add-on support)

The Full Add-On Support Build of ReShade provides the complete ReShade experience with all features unlocked, as this build offers full access to external add-ons and an entirely unlocked depth buffer regardless of internet connectivity. However, it's highly likely to be disallowed in most online multiplayer games and is blocked by a considerable amount of anti-cheat solutions, so it is not recommended for games with strict anti-cheat protection.
