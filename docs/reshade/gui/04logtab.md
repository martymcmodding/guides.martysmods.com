# Log Tab
The "Log" tab records ReShade’s runtime messages, including errors, warnings, and informational events. Reviewing these entries is essential for diagnosing shader-loading problems or other issues. Logs are saved as "ReShade.log" in your game’s root directory. Since the file is overwritten each time the game starts, copy or back up the log before exiting if you need to review or share it.
