# Add-ons
Add-ons for ReShade are extensions designed to integrate with your game and ReShade shaders. They simplify configuration and enable modifications beyond the default capabilities. By default, every ReShade installation includes the "Generic Depth" add-on. This component lets ReShade calculate depth and normal buffers for shaders that require them.
